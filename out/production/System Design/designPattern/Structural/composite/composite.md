<strong>Composite Pattern:</strong>
<p>
The Composite Pattern allows you to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly by organizing them 
into a tree structure. It is particularly useful for representing part-whole hierarchies, such as file systems.
</p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<p>
In a file system, files are individual elements (leaves), while directories are collections of files or other directories (composites). 
Using the Composite Pattern, you can perform operations like displaying details or calculating the total size 
of a directory uniformly for both files and directories.
