 <h2>Visitor Design Pattern</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Visitor Design Pattern</strong> is a <strong>behavioral design pattern</strong> that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects they operate on. 
        This pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform operations across a set of objects with varying types but want to keep the operations decoupled from these objects.

 <h3>Key Concepts of Visitor Design Pattern</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Visitor Interface</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Declares a set of visit methods for each type of element in the object structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Visitor</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Implements the visitor interface and defines the specific operations to perform on the elements.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Element Interface</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Declares an <code>accept</code> method that takes a visitor as an argument.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Concrete Elements</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the element interface and define the <code>accept</code> method to call the appropriate method on the visitor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Object Structure</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>A collection of elements that can be iterated to apply the visitor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

 <h3>Example: File System</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine a file system with different types of files (e.g., text files, image files) where you need to perform operations like compression and virus scanning.
