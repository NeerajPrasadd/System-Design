Command design pattern

we need four component 
     <br>1.Command interface - which will have action to perform method i,e Execute
    <br>2.Concrete implementation 
    <br>3.Invoker class (task scheduler)
    <br>4.Receiver : the actual object that will perform action (EmailService,BAckupService)
