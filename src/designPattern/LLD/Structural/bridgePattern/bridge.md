<strong>Bridge Design Pattern:</strong>
<p>
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing 
them to vary independently. It is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between 
an abstraction and its implementation.
</p>

<strong>Real-Time Example:</strong>
<p>
Consider a remote controller for various devices (e.g., TVs, projectors, music systems). The abstraction 
is the remote controller, while the implementation represents the device. The Bridge Pattern allows 
you to use the same remote interface for different devices by delegating implementation-specific 
behavior to device-specific classes.
</p>

<strong>Class Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Abstraction (<code>Remote</code>):</strong> The abstract class representing the interface 
        for a remote controller. It delegates operations to the implementation (device).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Refined Abstraction (<code>AdvancedRemote</code>):</strong> Extends the abstraction by adding more functionalities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementor (<code>Device</code>):</strong> The interface representing the device. This defines device-specific operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Concrete Implementor (<code>TV</code> and <code>Projector</code>):</strong> Concrete classes that implement the <code>Device</code> interface, defining behavior for specific devices.
    </li>
</ul>
