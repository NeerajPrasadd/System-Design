<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Flyweight Pattern:</strong> The Flyweight Pattern is used to share and reuse a limited number of 
        objects among multiple clients, reducing memory and resource overhead.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Connection Pooling:</strong> In connection pooling, instead of creating a new connection for every 
        database request, a pool of reusable connections is maintained. When a client requests a connection, 
        an available connection is provided from the pool, and when the client is done, the connection is returned to the pool.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Intrinsic State:</strong> In the context of the connection pool, the intrinsic state is the shared database 
        connection object itself (e.g., connection configurations like host, port, and database name).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Extrinsic State:</strong> Extrinsic states include properties that are unique to each client request 
        (e.g., SQL query, transaction details), which are managed separately by the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Benefits:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces the overhead of repeatedly creating and closing database connections.</li>
            <li>Improves application performance by reusing existing connections.</li>
            <li>Efficiently manages limited database connection resources in high-traffic applications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
